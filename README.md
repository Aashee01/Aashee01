## About Me

Ever since writing my first program and manipulate it to produce desired output , I have been obsessed with the of using software to solve practical problems. Software engineering is never ending puzzle that I am passionately engaged in solving. I believe in the power of programming to transform and improve lives of the people around the world.

Today I am an Experienced Software Engineer with a demonstrated history of working . Currently pursuing Master of Computer Application(MCA) from International Institute of Professional Studies. Along with coding , I love to do planting. Both pursuits challenges in so many aspects of intellect : creativity , optimistic, problem solving. This is what keeps me up, a never ending thirst to create powerful things to share them with the world
